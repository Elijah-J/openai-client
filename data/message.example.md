The Importance of Clean Code

Writing clean code is essential for long-term project maintainability. When code is well-structured and follows consistent patterns, it becomes easier for teams to collaborate effectively. Clean code principles include meaningful variable names, single responsibility functions, and clear documentation.

Key benefits include:
1. Reduced debugging time
2. Easier onboarding for new team members
3. Lower maintenance costs
4. Better scalability

Remember that code is read far more often than it is written. Therefore, optimizing for readability should be a primary concern for all developers.

## Usage

To use this formatter:
1. Replace this content with your actual text
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Check the formatted output in `output.md`
